zipcode was treated as string because some cells are invalid (e.g. decimal, borough)
in postgres, put community, congressional, state senatorial as numeric because some are na and some are float and city council to varchar for
the same reason,
Did a minor change in the cleaned csv: change birth month, license issued/expired date variables data types to date.
Deleted rows containing null or unreadable values in variables license issues/expired date (about 240 obs)
Zip code and license issued date contain null in the final dataset.
